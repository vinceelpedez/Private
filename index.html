                My Dearest Faith,<br><br>
                I want you to know how happy and thankful I am to have you in my life. These past few months have had their ups and downs, but your constant presence always makes me feel at home and realize how lucky I am to have a wonderful person like you to love and care for me.

Faith, I am grateful for you and I love you so much that the mere thought of your absence hurts me deeply. No matter what happens, I will stick with you until the end, Love Ko. I know we've had it hard sometimes, and I know you're tired of my constant mistakes and imperfections, but thank you, Love, for sticking with me.

I promise you that I am getting better and trying my very best to show you and give you the love that you deserve. I love you with all my heart. Thank you, I love you so much. Happy Monthsary, Love Ko, and here's to many more monthsaries and years to come, to celebrate and cherish with you.<br><br>
                Forever Yours,<br>
                Vincent
